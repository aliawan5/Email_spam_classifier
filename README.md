get this dataset from kaggle and train this using machine learning algorithm also perforn some natural language processing technique like Tokenization and stopwords removal and built a pipeline that consist of vectorizer and a classifier and train the model using that pipeline after the accuracy is not stasify then i balanced the dataset and their is significant change in accuracy that can shown in classification report and confusion matrix
